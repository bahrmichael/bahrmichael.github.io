Hi! I'm Michael and I burn for all things serverless. Since 2020 I'm also working as a Software Developer at AWS in Berlin, Germany.

This blog will challenge you with new ideas, mostly reolving around serverless tech. Some are pretty neat, others make you ask "but why?" Take that input and twist in your own ways :) You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bahrdev) and sign up for my mailing in the top right.

My favourite newsletters are [Off By None](https://www.jeremydaly.com/newsletter/) and [Last Week in AWS](http://lastweekinaws.com/).

This blog is hosted with GitHub Pages. Articles on this blog will also be published on [dev.to](https://dev.to/michabahr) and [medium](https://medium.com/@michabahr).
